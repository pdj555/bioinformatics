# Bioinformatics Analysis Repository

Welcome to our bioinformatics project repository. This repository contains a variety of files and Jupyter notebooks to assist with biological data analysis.

## What's Included

### Jupyter Notebooks
The notebooks provide guided workflows for common bioinformatics tasks such as:
- Quality control and preprocessing of nucleotide sequence data
- Read alignment and mapping
- Variant calling and annotation
- Exploratory data analysis with biological datasets

### Data Files
The `/data` directory contains example datasets commonly used in bioinformatics. These include:
- FASTQ sequence files
- FASTA sequence files
- SAM/BAM alignment files
- VCF/BCF variant call files

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Unix or macOS
   .\env\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies** using `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Open Jupyter notebooks**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. **Access and run the notebooks** in your browser. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to execute the analysis workflows.
